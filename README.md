# 4R
A Cool Sign In Way (Avoiding From Brute Force Attacks)

Hello And Welcome To 4R Sign In Way :)
This code provides a very basic and minimalistic password authentication system that relies on the user inputting characters at specific positions in their password. It is not suitable for real-world security purposes and should be considered a learning exercise. For real-world applications, more robust and secure authentication methods should be used, such as hashing and salting passwords, implementing rate limiting, and using secure protocols like HTTPS.
Also You can merge with high secure protocols.

- [CLI](#cli)
- [GUI](#gui)

## CLI
   1. Clone The Repository
   ```
 git clone https://github.com/Athede-v/4R.git && 4R\CLI
   ```
   3. Run app.py (-python 3.11)
   ```
     py app.py
   ```

   **How it Works:**
   
   You can customize the code and add additional security protocols to strengthen 4R. The template for the CLI is as follows:
   
     X-X-X-X
     1-5-8-1
   
   This Is Template Of The CLI So At First Enter Your 8-Char Password By 
    `$UR >>> set pass`
   Command , Type In The Console And Press Enter
   
   To test the 4R Sign-In Method, use the
    `$UR >>> run`
   Command , Just Type In The Console And Press Enter Bro 
   
   Some options are currently active for enhanced security. You can modify or replace the code as needed; it's a straightforward implementation.

Type exit to exit the program. So Have Fun :) ([@athede-v](https://github.com/Athede-v))

app.c, app.cpp, and app.js mirror the functionality of app.py but in different programming languages. Similarly, simple.py accomplishes the same task as app.py but with cleaner and more concise code compared to app.py.

## GUI
   1. Clone The Repository
   ```
 git clone https://github.com/Athede-v/4R.git && cd 4R\GUI
   ```
   2. Install Packages
   ```
     npm install
   ```
   3. And Start Test Server
   ```
     npm start
   ```
   4. Go To `http://localhost:3000/` URL
